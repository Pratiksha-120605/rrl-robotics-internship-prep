# RRL Robotics Internship Preparation 🚀  
A structured learning repository documenting my journey of preparing for the Robotics Reinforcement Learning (RRL) internship task — including Linux, ROS2, Gazebo, Nav2, Docker, and simulation workflows.

---

## 📌 About This Repository  
This repository tracks my progress as I set up a complete robotics environment on Ubuntu, learn ROS2 fundamentals, explore Gazebo simulation, and implement a digital robot with the Nav2 navigation stack — following the instructions and video tutorial provided by the interview panel.

The goal is to show consistency, growth, and readiness for the internship.

## 📅 Learning Roadmap (1 Month Plan)

### **Week 1 — System Setup & Basics**
- [x] Learn Linux fundamentals (terminal commands)
- [x] Install Ubuntu (Dual Boot)
- [x] Install ROS2 Humble
- [x] Install VS Code on Ubuntu
- [x] Setup essential tools (colcon, git, Python3)

### **Week 2 — ROS2 Fundamentals**
- [ ] Understand nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers
- [ ] Create & run basic ROS2 Python package
- [ ] Build and source workspaces
- [ ] Run ROS2 examples (turtlesim)

### **Week 3 — Simulation & Nav2**
- [ ] Install Gazebo / Ignition
- [ ] Launch basic robot simulation
- [ ] Install Nav2 stack
- [ ] Follow the tutorial video (Digital Robot + Nav2)
- [ ] Implement navigation (send goal → robot moves)

### **Week 4 — Docker + Final Deliverables**
- [ ] Learn Docker basics
- [ ] Run ROS2 + Nav2 inside Docker container
- [ ] Record final simulation demo
- [ ] Prepare documentation + cleanup

## ⭐ Final Goal  
By the end of this preparation, I aim to have a clean, working **digital robot simulation** with:
- ROS2 Humble  
- Nav2  
- Gazebo  
- Working navigation goals  
- Dockerized environment  
- Clear documentation  

This repository will serve as the complete record of my progress toward the RRL internship.
